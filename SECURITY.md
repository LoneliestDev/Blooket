GitHub Repository Security Policy
Purpose

The purpose of this security policy is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information stored in the GitHub repository. This policy outlines the best practices and guidelines for maintaining a secure repository in order to protect against unauthorized access, malicious activities, and data breaches.
Policy

    Access Control

    1.1. Only authorized personnel must be granted access to the repository.

    1.2. Access should be granted based on the principle of least privilege - users should only have the necessary level of access required to perform their duties.

    Sensitive information

    3.1. Sensitive information, such as credentials, API keys, or personally identifiable information (PII), must not be stored directly in the repository.

    3.2. Utilize a secure credentials management system to handle sensitive information.

    3.3. Encrypt sensitive information using approved encryption algorithms before storing it.

    Branching and Merging

    4.1. Code changes must be made in feature branches and merged through pull requests.

    4.2. Pull requests should only be approved and merged by authorized personnel.

    4.3. Automated code scanning tools should be used to perform code review before merging pull requests.

    Vulnerability Management

    5.1. Regularly scan the repository for vulnerabilities and ensure all dependencies are up to date.

    5.2. Promptly address identified vulnerabilities and incorporate vulnerability fixes into the codebase.

    Monitoring and Logging

    6.1. Enable repository activity monitoring to detect any malicious or unauthorized access attempts.

    6.2. Implement logging mechanisms to record repository events and actions.

    6.3. Regularly review logs to identify and respond to any suspicious activities.

    Incident Response

    7.1. Establish an incident response plan to handle security incidents related to the repository.

    7.2. Define clear roles and responsibilities for incident handling.

    7.3. Ensure that incidents are reported, investigated, and resolved promptly.

    Security Training and Awareness

    8.1. Provide security training and awareness sessions to all repository contributors.

    8.2. Notify contributors about security best practices and any relevant policy updates.

    8.3. Encourage reporting of any security concerns or incidents.
